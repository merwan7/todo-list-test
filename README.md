# TODO JS Test
This test is designed to see if the developer understand the following in Javascript:
Scoping/context, Hoisting, Runtime, Mutation, Debounce

# RULES
- Solve Errors and add the Features in the list below.
- **Do not modify api timeout's**, they simulate the server lag

1. Hosting: app is not defined
2. Run Time: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
3. Scope/Context: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
4. Definition: In the UI, the list displays an undefined, fix it
5. Add Feature: `App.add()` is incomplete, it's been hooked up to the UI already but currently doesn't add to the api.
6. Toggle Feature: Have `App.toggle()` toggle the state of the selected item. It's already hooked up in the UI.
7. Mutation: Fix the search input field. Type in `feed`. The filter is currently displaying the wrong items. Also, when you click on the `All` filter it doesn't display all items.
8. Search Feature: fix the filters for `Active` and `Complete` to only show todo's based on if it's done or not.
